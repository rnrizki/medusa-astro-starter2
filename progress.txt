## 2026-01-20 - Feature 5: Cloudflare adapter configured for static deployment

**Status:** Complete

**Work done:**
- Installed `@astrojs/cloudflare`
- Configured adapter in `astro.config.mjs`
- Set output to static
- Added `.env` file with dummy keys to allow build to proceed
- Updated `src/pages/products/[handle].astro` to handle build-time fetch errors gracefully (returning empty paths if backend/keys invalid)
- Verified build succeeds (with expected warnings about image service and empty product list)

**Verification:**
- `pnpm run lint` - 0 errors
- `pnpm build --filter storefront` - Success (after error handling update)

**Notes for next person:**
- Feature 5 is complete.
- Feature 25 (Cart sidebar open/close) is verified as done in code but needs to be marked in PRD.
- Feature 28 (CartButton in header) is Critical and missing - this should be prioritized to enable cart access.
- The `.env` file is present but contains dummy keys. For full e2e testing, valid Medusa keys are needed.

## 2026-01-20 - Feature 28: CartButton in header shows item count

**Status:** Complete

**Work done:**
- Created `src/components/react/CartButton.tsx`
- Subscribed to `$cartCount` store using `@nanostores/react`
- Display cart icon (SVG shopping bag) with count badge
- Badge shows count, caps at "99+" for large numbers
- Opens cart sidebar on click via `openCart()` action
- Added proper aria-label for accessibility
- Also marked Feature 25 as passing in PRD (was verified but not marked)

**Verification:**
- `pnpm run lint` - 0 errors
- `pnpm run test` - No tests configured (passes)

**Notes for next person:**
- Feature 28 is complete. CartButton can now be used in the Header component.
- Feature 11 (Header) is the next logical feature to implement - it needs CartButton (now done).
- Feature 13 (Homepage) and Feature 14 (Product listing) are also critical priorities.
- The CartButton uses `client:visible` directive when included in Astro components.
- The `.env` file still has dummy keys. For full e2e testing, valid Medusa keys are needed.

## 2026-01-20 - Feature 11: Header component with logo, navigation, and cart icon

**Status:** Complete

**Work done:**
- Created `src/components/astro/Header.astro`
- Added logo/site name ("Storefront") linking to home
- Added navigation links to Products and Collections
- Included CartButton React island with `client:visible` directive
- Used semantic HTML (`<header>`, `<nav>`)
- Navigation highlights current path (active state)
- Sticky header with border
- Updated BaseLayout to include Header and wrapped slot in `<main>` tag

**Verification:**
- `pnpm run lint` - 0 errors

**Notes for next person:**
- Feature 11 is complete. Header now appears on all pages using BaseLayout.
- Feature 12 (Footer) is next logical layout component (MEDIUM priority).
- Feature 13 (Homepage) is CRITICAL and needs implementation.
- Feature 14 (Product listing page) is CRITICAL and needs implementation.
- Navigation links to /products and /collections but those pages may not exist yet.
