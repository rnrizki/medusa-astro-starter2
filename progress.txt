## 2026-01-20 - Feature 34: Order confirmation page displays after successful checkout

**Status:** Complete

**Work done:**
- Created `src/components/react/OrderConfirmation.tsx` Preact island.
- Implemented client-side fetching of order details using `retrieveOrder` SDK function.
- Displays success message, order ID, email, shipping address, order items, and total.
- Handles loading and error states.
- Created `src/pages/order/index.astro` to host the confirmation component.
- Updated `CheckoutForm` to redirect to `/order?id={id}` (using query params to support static hosting).
- Added `retrieveOrder` helper to `src/lib/medusa.ts`.
- Verified build passes and linting passes.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm run lint` - Success.
- `pnpm --filter storefront build` - Success (generated `/order/index.html`).

**Notes for next person:**
- Feature 34 (Order confirmation) is complete. The checkout flow is now end-to-end complete.
- Feature 18 (Product variants) is CRITICAL. Currently, users can only buy the first variant. This should be the top priority.
- Feature 46 (Open Graph meta tags) is a good quick SEO win.
- Feature 12 (Footer) is still pending.
