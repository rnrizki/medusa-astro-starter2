# Progress Log

## 2026-01-20 - Feature 4: Astro project initialized with React and Tailwind

**Status:** Complete

**Work done:**
- Created `/apps/storefront` directory structure
- Added `package.json` with Astro 5.8, React 18.3, Tailwind 3.4 dependencies
- Configured `astro.config.mjs` with static output, React and Tailwind integrations
- Set up `tsconfig.json` with strict mode and `@/` path alias
- Created `tailwind.config.mjs` with content paths for Astro files
- Added `src/styles/global.css` with Tailwind directives
- Created `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro` as base template
- Added `src/pages/index.astro` as homepage placeholder
- Created sample `src/components/react/Counter.tsx` to verify React integration

**Verification:**
- `pnpm install` - success
- `pnpm run lint` - 0 errors, 0 warnings
- `pnpm run test` - no tests to run (expected)
- `pnpm build` (storefront) - builds successfully, outputs to dist/

**Notes for next person:**
- Monorepo setup (features 1-3) was already complete when I started
- Feature 5 (Cloudflare adapter) is next priority if staying on storefront-setup
- Feature 6 (MedusaJS SDK client) is also critical priority
- Consider installing @medusajs/js-sdk for feature 6
