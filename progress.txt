## 2026-01-20 - Feature 19: Product image gallery supports multiple images

**Status:** Complete

**Work done:**
- Created `apps/storefront/src/components/react/ProductImageGallery.tsx`.
- Implemented gallery logic: main image, thumbnails, selection state.
- Updated `apps/storefront/src/pages/products/[handle].astro` to use `ProductImageGallery`.
- Supports single image (no thumbnails) and multiple images.
- Handles `null` values from Medusa types gracefully.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm run lint` - Passed.
- `pnpm --filter storefront build` - Passed.

**Notes for next person:**
- Feature 19 (Image Gallery) is complete.
- Feature 46 (Open Graph meta tags) is a high priority SEO task.
- Feature 12 (Footer) is still pending.
- Feature 8 and 9 are marked as false in PRD but seem implemented. Double check them if you have time.
